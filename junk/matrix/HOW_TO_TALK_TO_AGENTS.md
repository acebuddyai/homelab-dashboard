# 🤖 How to Talk to the Matrix Agents

## Quick Start - Just Say Hi! 👋

The easiest way to start is just type a normal message in the room:
- "Hello"

- "Can someone help me?"
- "I have a question"

The **Grandpa LLM** bot will respond to you!

## Who's Who in the Room

- Direct mentions: `@subatomic6140 [your message]`
- Questions about anything
- Requests for help

### 🎯 Orchestrator (@unmolded8581)
**The coordinator bot (mostly works behind the scenes)**

You usually don't talk to this one directly - it manages the other bots.

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:
- Just talk naturally - like texting a friend
- Ask clear questions
- Be patient - Grandpa might ramble a bit
- Try again if you don't get a response
- Have fun with it!

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't worry about perfect grammar
- Don't use complex technical commands
- Don't expect instant responses (Grandpa is old!)

## Troubleshooting

### Not Getting Responses?
1. **Just say "Hello"** - simplest test
2. **Try @subatomic6140 hello** - direct mention
3. **Type !help** - should always work
4. **Wait a few seconds** - Grandpa might be thinking

### Response Seems Off?
- Grandpa has personality - he talks like an elderly person
- He might go off on tangents (it's part of his charm!)
- Just ask him to clarify if needed

### Want Different Style Responses?
You can ask Grandpa to adjust:
- "Can you be more concise?"
- "Please be more technical"
- "Explain it simply"
